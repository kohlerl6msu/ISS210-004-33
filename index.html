                <div class="container"><p>The issue of legalizing marijuana is complicated within the United States. With it becoming a racial/social issue with “Black people 3.64 times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana possession, notwithstanding comparable usage rates” (via ACLU.org). In my own life, I’ve heard of a story of a white male who was around 17 years old. He got pulled over by the police with a substantial amount of marijuana in his trunk, but the person’s father knew the cop personally. With this connection, he was able to keep driving and be exempt from any trouble that many others have faced. What if it was a poor African American male driving through a rich suburb, would the consequences be similar? There is a long history of the prohibition of marijuana, and it mainly stems from racist origins. Throughout our website, we talk about the positives of the legalization of marijuana, the history of marijuana, and statistics regarding marijuana. We believe that marijuana should be legal, while it should be used in moderation—it poses many benefits. With our history trying to impose in us that marijuana is bad, it evidently poses more benefits for many people.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana, has been shown to have benefits and to treat a number of illnesses. According to one study, medical cannabis can help with the symptoms of chronic pain. Participants who took cannabis reported significantly less pain than those who did not (Ware, Wang, Shapiro, Robinson, & Ducruet, 2010). Additionally, patients who use medical cannabis report a significant decrease in spasms, making it a promising therapy for the muscle spasms related to multiple sclerosis (Zajicek et al., 2012).

Additionally, it has been discovered that cannabis may reduce the signs of sadness and anxiety. Cannabis use was linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression in individuals with chronic illnesses including cancer, together with MS (Katzman, Smith, & Mason, 2018). Another study also revealed that cannabis use may reduce the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with patients who used cannabis reporting much fewer symptoms than those who did not (Wilkinson et al., 2019). These studies illustrate the potential advantages of using cannabis for medicinal purposes to treat a variety of illnesses. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> To summarize the video in short: When Mexicans immigrated to the United States in the 1900s they brought along smoking marijuana (or marihuana) recreationally. Right after the prohibition ended in 1933—Harry Anslinger wanted to put an end to marijuana. He took the non-evident claim that marijuana was a violence inducing drug and connected that to African American and Hispanic people to cause terror and cause more discrimination with the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Alongside this act, Harry Anslinger claimed marijuana made black people “forget their place in society” and took a shot at the predominantly African-American genre of music: Jazz. He claimed that jazz was “evil music” and was formed under the influence of marijuana. After the rebellious hippy era of the 60s—Nixon repealed the Marihuana Tax Act in 1970. Instead, he reclassified it as a schedule 1 drug; the schedule 1 drug is classified as a high potential for abuse and addiction (other drugs in that category: heroin, LSD, and ecstasy). In a report in 2010, it was said that both black and white people consume marijuana at the same rate, but black people have been approximately four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. In society today, using Marijuana recreationally is legal in some states, but the federal law still stands that marijuana is a schedule 1 controlled substance. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br> On the federal level, marijuana is still illegal.  However, as Robinson notes in his thesis, many states are beginning to legalize the drug and are benefitting economically from doing so.  With a federal legalization, not only could research be more available and conductible, but the funding for it would be more efficient as well.  Harmfulness taxes are a large piece of why legalizing marijuanna wouldn’t have the quantity of negative effects often advertised.  Harmfulness taxes, also known as excise taxes, work to offset the negative effects associated with substances like alcohol and tobacco already.  The money from these taxes is used to create programs that help users who may struggle with abuse or addiction, study the health effects of substances, and deter youth from using before brain maturation is complete.  With these social frameworks in place, the possible harmful effects of the plant are severely mitigated; just another piece of information leading us to believe marijuana isn’t the monster that it’s made out to be.  Back to the economic benefits, Robinson exemplifies California, a recently weed-legal state, and its estimated intake of $643 excise taxes from marijuana in the first full year of legalization.  The state has come out with a plan for spending on youth treatment and prevention, environmental protection, and investment in communities most harmed by the war on drugs.  The money influx of marijuana allows governments and social institutions to re-invest in their societies, leading to a healthier, happier population.  In the battle for legalization, voting is the most important thing—and with that comes spreading awareness.  We are confident in our stance and that if more people had access to the information, they would be likely to vote for legalization.  One could share this website or its references with friends and family so they can learn more about marijuana and its many benefits to the individual and society.

                                    <p class="mb-4"> Over the years, public opinion on legalizing weed has undergone a significant shift. The Pew Research Center's article "Public Opinion about Legalizing Marijuana" covers this change. According to the article, while support for legalizing marijuana has remained relatively stable in recent years, there has been a significant increase in support for legalization over the past few decades. In the 1990s, only about 25% of Americans supported legalizing marijuana, but by 2021, that number had increased to 60%. This change in public opinion can be attributed to several factors, including increased awareness of the medical benefits of marijuana, the failure of the war on drugs, and a growing recognition of racial disparities in drug enforcement. As a result, more and more states and countries are legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use, and the stigma surrounding marijuana use is slowly diminishing.</p>

When discussing the volatile topic of Marijuana Legalisation, a common age group that is mentioned in these debates is none other than adolescents/teenagers. Described as the most formative/developmental years of one's lifespan, a clear argument for keeping these young adults away from mind-altering substances like marijuana seems to exist, but data from various sources would seem to disagree.

Shown to have potential benefits with conditions such as anxiety and depression, marijuana can be a possible key player in stunting the growing mental health crisis in America. A study conducted by Susan A. Stoner at the University of Washington states “THC appears to decrease anxiety at lower doses and increase anxiety at higher doses.” (Stoner 1). Although the increased anxiety at high doses sounds like an objective negative, the amount of THC required to reach that point is outside of the scope of using Marijuana as a treatment for existing conditions such as anxiety and depression

Teenagers' persistent pain brought on by illnesses or injuries has also been connected to marijuana use as a pain reliever. “THC, a substance present in marijuana plants, may help reduce inflammation and relieve chronic pain”, according to studies (Xiong-XI). Backing up this claim, according to the CDC, “A few studies have found that marijuana can be helpful in treating neuropathic pain (a specific type of chronic pain caused by damaged nerves)” (CDC 1).


There are risks involved with juvenile drug use, just like with any substance taken recreationally or medicinally; however, some difficulties, such reduced cognitive function or addiction issues, require more immediate care than others. Instead of outright criminalising its use, rules that assure safe consuming practices, such as offering parental education and age verification methods created at the dispensary level, can greatly lower these hazards.


In conclusion, marijuana may have a number of therapeutic advantages when used properly, and for the right reasons. As presented earlier, marijuana may be useful for teen patients with mental health issues like depression and anxiety, along with being a reliable pain reliever for those suffering from injuries, chronic disease, or other painful medical conditions. Teenage marijuana use carries hazards like the use of any other substance, but those risks can be reduced by using the drug responsibly along with being monitored by a parent/guardian or professional.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Cannabis can be really good for people because it can relax the mind and tend to put people in better moods, most people use it for pleasure and recreation, its not an hardcore drug like meth or any other drugs. While cannabis is still not legal everywhere I believe that if it’s going to be legal everywhere that there should be a legal limit like 21 for all states that would still keep young teens from being able to buy the drug. As making it legal could also stop a lot of the selling on the streets as those people could just go to the dispensary and buy cannabis without having any altercations with the huge amount of sellers. </p>
